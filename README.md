**Huborg - You are the Black Market!** The number one dystopian first-person role-playing game that revolutionized the turn of the 20th century. What are you willing to do in order to fulfill your capitalistic desires of eating and drinking? How far are you willing to go? Are you willing to sacrifice your humanity? You have to face the duality between being a man or a machine. The game was created in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam / Finnish Game Jam 2022.
